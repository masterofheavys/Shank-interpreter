# Shank-interpreter
archive of icsi 311 shank interpreter
This was a semester long coding project assigned by professor michael phipps. 
The prupose of this project was to create a functioning interpreter using the principles of lexing, parsing, and interpreting a lanugage designed by professor michael phipps. 
While this repo will initially serve as simply an archive for the project, I plan and going back and cleaing up the code.
